# Battle Ship

## About 

A console app that simulate battle ship game between two players.
The app like this is a good algorithm challanege.
For me the main problem was C# and how to keep code clean.
I don't have a huge expirience with C#, I wrote few game prototypes using Unity more then a year ago.
I tried to avoid 'Magic numbers' in my code, so I created some enums and consts.
The most dificult was hot to minimize conditions inside single method, I tried to externalize as many methods as posible.
In the solution are some tests, which helped deal with minimizing methods.

## Requirements

 - .Net 5 SDK - to build the project
